Requirements
  A linux system.
  gcc 4.8.4
  python 2.7.6
  boost 1.64.0
  igraph C library (publicly available at the website igraph.org/c/)
  libxml2 library (used for read xx.GraphML files)

Overview Description
  We give the codes of query generation, result evaluation and methods used in our paper. The other resources (data, query and result) are publicly available at https://pan.baidu.com/s/1htG9TIk. Details can be found there. 


Description of the folder "codes"
  In each folder, the executable file can be generated by using the command 
'g++ -std=c++11 -I/path to igraph/include/igraph -L/path to igraph/lib -ligraph -I/path to boost  `ls *.cpp`'

  KDR contains the methods proposed in our paper (KD, Loc-kdr and speed-up strategies).
  MDC, LCTC and GrCon contain the codes of the corresponding methods respectively.
  The folder generator1 gives the method to generate queries for Section 4.2 in our paper.
  The folder generator2 gives the method to generate queries for Sections 4.3 and 4.4.
  The folders evluator1 to evaluator3 are used to measure the kd-metric, F1-score and weighted edge density respectively.


If you still have questions about the public codes, data, queries and results, please contact me through the email "wangzhuo@iie.ac.cn". Thank you!
